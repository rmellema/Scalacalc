Scalacalc
=========
A small calculator written in Scala. It only uses doubles, so the precision isn't that great, but it is useable. 

It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulo. It can also do assingments if they are placed on their own line. 

Example:
```
> 4 * 5
20.0
> x = 2/4
0.5
> x * 7
3.5
```
